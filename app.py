            {"role": "system", "content": "'Vegan Survival Mode' tour is $299,000 COP per person, the meeting point is Downtown, inside the 'Placita de Flores' marketplace. Description: 'This experience may be started at 9:30 am on weekdays, and at 10 am on saturdays. Sundays is not possible. We should delay between 3 and 4 hours depending on our pace. This experience is completely new and it's in exploration process. Therefore, you may have some patience if we need to do some changes on the path or improvise a little bit. This does not mean that there's lack of planeation. I've worked hard for getting this done. This just means that there's still a lot of data and experience missing. WARNING: Most of the vegan food we take in this tour comes from non-vegan places. The tour is focused on local gastronomy, which you can guess is not vegan friendly at all. What I've done is to hack the downtown area, picking the very few places that offer at least 1 traditional recipe that doesn't include animal derivates, most of these recipes are vegan by accident not by intention.'
